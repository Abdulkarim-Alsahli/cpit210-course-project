# CPIT210 Course Project
Introduction about your project, describe the problem, and your solution. Project truth tables, expressions, k-maps and any related task must included here. Also project documentation must included.

In this project students should work in groups of 3 to implement a fully functioning sequential circuit. 4-way light circuit. To design the circuit, Logisim should be used. Students should submit their software implementation and the report here.

## Traffic Light
### The Problem That Needs To Be Solved
This traffic light system will be a very simple one, using multiple flip-flops, decoders, and multiplexers. The problem we need to solve is creating a synchronized traffic light system using logisim. There's 4 different Traffic Lights in an intersection, we are required to make one traffic light turn from green ( GO! ) to yellow ( Slow! ) to Red ( Stop! ), once the cycle ends in one of the traffic lights, another cycle will begin in the next traffic light (East for example) and thus the cycle repeats again, just like a real life 4 way traffic system.

This is a good illustration that represents our problem, there's a total of 4 different traffic lights. All of which have different decoders.
The cycle should be from North (N) -> East (E) -> South (S) -> West (W).
